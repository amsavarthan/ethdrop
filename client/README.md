# Ethdrop Client

This folder 🗂 contains the react code for ethdrop.

### Getting Started

 1. Run `yarn` 🧑🏻‍💻

> You need to compile truffle contract before proceeding to next step. To know how please check out [Truffle 🍩](https://github.com/amsavarthan/ethdrop/tree/main/client/truffle  "Truffle 🍩") folder.

 2. Navigate to **src/utils/index.ts** and paste your contract address.
 3. Run `yarn start` which starts a development server at [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) 😇

> Nothing will work here since the server is not CORS enabled. Please go to [Server 🗄](https://github.com/amsavarthan/ethdrop/tree/main/server  "Server 🗄") folder for further instructions.
